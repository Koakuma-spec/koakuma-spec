                It was at a large soccer stadium, the busy staff were testing the stereos and affixing posters, all in preparation for the concert. Outside the venue, a large screen is undergoing its final installation checkup, playing music videos of the popular singer - <span style="color: #496EE6">Xiao Miao</span>. A teenage girl entered the stadium, heading straight for the backstage - there, the contestants practiced their singing in unison.
                <p>During the music session, the young girl introduced herself to Xiao Miao and the judges as <span style="color: #496EE6">Dorothy</span>. Dorothy is a die-hard fan of Xiao Miao. She adores her character, and admires her outstanding stage performances. Dorothy regards her beloved idol as the embodiment of Venus, her fervid inspiration to keep singing!</p>
                <p>Once the competition had ended, everyone was left bedazzled by Dorothy's charming anthem. Even Xiao Miao had complimented the girl's talent in high praise. But she suggested a slight improvement to Dorothy's vocals so that her singing can be even more perfect. Under Xiao Miao's guidance, Dorothy's singing eventually became more and more identical hers... ...Until finally, her songs have outclassed all the other contestants', favourably granting her an immediate job offer. But just when Dorothy was looking forward to collaborating on stage, it was revealed that she was not hired to become a duet with her favorite artist--But to <span style="color: #496EE6">lip sync</span> for her.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The usual crowd of singers rehearsed their talents in the large soccer stadium - now completely transformed into a proper stage. As the music started playing, Xiao Miao revealed herself in a pose supported by flying harnesses, while Dorothy held the microphone in the dark. The opening faded, and it was time to chime the vocals - But Dorothy didn't sing. Instead, she walked towards Xiao Miao on the stage, and told her that she shouldn't adopt lip-syncing. Xiao Miao gazed back in a mild expression. It wasn't that she didn't want to sing. But that over the years of performance, the frequent use of her vocal cords had begun to fatigue. Her voice has degraded, but at the same time she didn't want to let down her fans. Xiao Miao, actually envies Dorothy... The girl with freedom. She has the freedom to sing songs, to write songs, to do whatever she wanted. Unlike Xiao Miao, whose whole life is now shackled under the weight of her own success. It was heartbreaking for Dorothy to hear the renowned singer talk about her misfortunes in front of her -- And that's why, she's even more determined to help Xiao Miao return to her former glory, she wants to help her idol sing again!</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Dorothy wrote a song for Xiao Miao, a song that will convey the strength she has given to the fans' hearts. This song, she hopes, will persuade Xiao Miao to embrace her true potential again.</p>
                <p>"It doesn't matter if I imitate your voice, it's not the real you. Everyone would be even more let down, if they were to find out that you were lip syncing!"</p>
                <p>However, Xiao Miao wasn't convinced. She protested with the excuse again about her degrading vocal cords, but not expecting Dorothy's persistence:</p>
                <p>"You have to put in the work yourself if you want to see improvement! Do you want to be stuck as nothing but a pretty face?"</p>
                <p>"<span style="color: #496EE6">Nothing but a pretty face</span>?" This phrase set her emotions aflame. Xiao Miao's rage creeped over her kind visage, she took Dorothy's gift and threw it under her heels, deriding it as lickspitting garbage! Xiao Miao denounced Dorothy's plan as nothing more than a selfish delusion. Deep down, she knows: her throat can not take the pressure. But on the other hand, lip syncing is the unheard cry of defeat. Xiao Miao can forsee the controversy and scandals inching closer towards her on both sides, her reputation at the mercy of people that treat her like a doll! Despite venting this, her anger had already spiraled out of control. Not only did Xiao Miao fire Dorothy on the spot, she also chased her out of the room as if she was a pest: "I have no need for you, I'll perform it all myself!"</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>On the first day of the concert, Dorothy bought a spot to watch Xiao Miao's performance. She was still worried about her. The big screen outside of the venue started playing the singer's latest song. Dorothy listened, and began picking up familiar elements of it...</p>
                <p>Impossible! This was the song she had written for Xiao Miao! But the lyrics were modified into a complete parody, the song not shy of abrasive internet slangs, in addition to innapropriate drum and DJ elements. In Xiao Miao's shameless presentation, she didn't really need a person to sing for her; the original song is played as she matches her lips. Except the original song, which was supposed to evoke positivity and inspiration, has now been completely degraded to commercialized junk! In a moment of truth, Dorothy realized that the so-called "character" she's been idolizing doesn't actually exist. This inspirational, talented singer Xiao Miao was only a delusion in her head. From the top-down, the real Xiao Miao sits on a throne of lies who steals other people's works! Heart full of resentment, Dorothy came up with a plan⸻As a betrayed, let-down admirer of the renowned celebrity, she will definitely <span style="color: #496EE6">expose</span> her, and reveal Xiao Miao's true character to the rest of her fanbase!</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>The stadium was large enough to seat up to ten thousand people, a continuous wave of fans all around the stage. The stage top had several silver-colored moving spotlights, shining on the giant posters hung all around the venue. It was a spectacular scenery. Every concert goer had glowsticks in their hands, illuminating sparsely around the stadium. At a distance, it resembled a beautiful and otherwordly galaxy.</p>
                <p>Dorothy stood at the entrance, looking up at the harnesses propped on the stage. She turned around to blend into the crowd, but her indifferent composure was strongly in contrast to that of the neighbouring fans. Finally, the lights have dimmed, and the show has begun. Xiao Miao's beautiful vocals started to ring across the venue, resonating with the crowd of cheering thousands, the heat and excitement enough to overpower the show itself! At the highest point of excitement, the spotlight revealed Xiao Miao -- Who was suspended by the harnesses, limbs tied together and mouth taped shut! Not a sound could leak from her, but strangely, why was there still singing? This abnormal scene rendered the enthusiastic crowd into dead silence. In the next moment, another set of spotlights turned towards the direction of the audience, shining on Dorothy. With a microphone in her hand, she was the one singing...</p>

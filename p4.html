                A TV displayed footage of the destroyed robot, Heroine Katie; the B.G. Amusement Park's kidnapping incident was all over the news -- the camera zoomed in on the broken arm of the beloved robot, and the crying faces of lamenting children. Amidst these shocking displays, a powerful woman's voice can be heard, censuring B.G. Corporation as a malicious entity: "Even after Heroine Katie took the children hostage, the company took no consideration for their safety by dispatching another robot to kill Katie!" The camera turned to the woman who spoke, her face pixelated on the screen for anonymity. In the interview, the mother explained that although many of the children were held captive because of the robotic actress, they were still very fond of Katie and trusted her like a friend. But in her last moments of the violent altercation with the other android who claimed to help her, Katie was essentially, "<span style="color: #496EE6">repaired to her death</span>" in front of the young kids. Such traumatic scenery would undoubtedly damage their mental health......
                <p>Huazhi Court; a lawyer paused the news segment. This was the plaintiff's introduction to seeking charges against B.G. Corporation; arguing that not only did the robots lack safety provisions, but that they have also caused serious psychological damage to the children who witnessed Katie's destruction. However, all of the follow-up documents proving the mental trauma were denied by and are being vehemently repressed by B.G.! Across the room, B.G.'s attorney refuted calmly. Their lawyer claimed that the content of the news was actually fabricated by a conspiring criminal. With a pointed finger, the true culprit behind this was already sitting on the defendant side -- She is <span style="color: #496EE6">Miss K.</span>!</p>
                <p>Everyone's attention turned to her; A petite and delicate-looking woman was sitting quietly there. Wearing a monocle, her eyes were staring into the distant emptiness. Expressionless and silent, her darker skin tone added more to her mysterious aura. Her body was wrapped in a classic women's trench coat, and her hands were covered with a pair of pale leather gloves - the ones favored by nobles. Under everyone's watchful eye, she nonchalantly brushed her fraying hair by her ears, her soft movements ever so elegant. Many impressions could arise from seeing this new face, but "<span style="color: #496EE6">cunning as a fox</span>" was not one of them. Members of the gallery discussed and murmured amongst each other, until B.G.'s attorney declared their case once again: "Miss K. is responsible for fabricating the news!"</p>
                <p>Miss K. did not budge in the face of accusation. She had her own lawyer defend her again, who insisted that everything portrayed in the video was factual and real. Because many people were interviewed to detail the events that happened during the amusement park incident, hence is why even in online discourse, netizens were castigating against B.G. Corporation, it is ultimately preposterous to assume that an incident affecting people of this scale could be fake!</p>
                <p>As though expecting this objection, B.G. revealed their best counter weapon: Using their flagship technology, they reverse-engineered the mosaic censorship to unblur the interviewees' faces. Deanonymized, all of them were Miss K.! And the online backlash? The vast majority of them were sockpuppet accounts whose IP addresses could be traced back to K.'s residence! Breaking the courtroom suspense, Miss K. had finally spoken up after holding back for so long -- "That's right. I've fooled everyone."</p>
                <p>The courtroom silenced, as K. continued to confess her "guilt": The videos were indeed disingenuous, and the accounts causing the drama and anger were all staged and manipulated. Miss K. bowed her head in apology, stating that everything she has done was due to the "no better alternatives." K.'s reason for acting as the interviewees was because she wanted to catch the corporation's attention. She wanted to propogate the truth, but was afraid of the company going after her, which is why she came up with the idea; Because she realized, that even if people were to read the kidnapping incident and take it at face value, it would only be a matter of time before the news gets buried and forgotten due to passing trends or some other societal drama more palatable to the common folk. And so, that was the reason why she began to manipulate the trend herself. Even if genuine citizens wanted to speak up about it, the face of B.G.'s public relations would swiftly cover their hide. The only way to prevent this from happening is to keep the public informed and angry about the incident, until it becomes so "<span style="color: #496EE6">viral</span>", that the truth can finally stay afloat! -- "People online have short-term memory, and I just wanted to shine a light on what really happened, hoping that more people would pay attention..... I don't think I've done anything wrong here."</p>
                <p>After saying this, numerous comments and heated online discourse have propped up as this trial was broadcasted live: some people believed that K. was just making an excuse to wiggle her way out of guilt; others were convinced by K's way of "honesty", seeing her as a brave activist who's really speaking up about the issue before anyone else. But a pivotal consensus was emerged among those who exaluated this trial: Instead of punishing real criminals, the legal system is being exploited by capitalists in order to censor whistleblowers! Her voice no longer represented herself soley, as countless people now believe that Miss K. is speaking out to protest injustice, a true heroine who had the guts to stand up against evil.</p>
                <p>The first hearing has concluded. The Judge ruled in favor of B.G. Corporation in the lawsuit. Following this, Miss K.'s journalism license will be permanently revoked, and will be issued the corresponding sentencing for her crime. This verdict, however, immediately angered the public, as people demanded that a retrial should be held: "If you're going to criminalize people speaking the truth, whose interests are you really protecting here?!" Witnesses of the gallery were so enraged, that someone even started throwing their shoes at the Judge and the B.G. attorney. United in their outcry against turning favor to the tech giant, more people have followed suit and began hurling objects for further humiliation, the entire courtroom spiraling into physical mayhem. Miss K. however, gracefully rose up from her seat and carried her floral umbrella away with her, as though she has nothing to do with the unfolded chaos. She casually exited out of the courtroom and building, tipping the tip of her brimmed hat to look up at the clouded sun in the sky. An unsettling grin molded on her face -- As long as the "<span style="color: #496EE6">truth</span>" prevails, the methodology does not matter. Mayhaps, it is necessary to fight lies with lies.</p>
